# UPG - UserPasswordGenerator

**UPG - UserPasswordGenerator** is a powerful tool designed to generate personalized password dictionaries based on user-provided information. Inspired by tools like CUPP, UPG takes it a step further with enhanced features like extended Leet-speak, separators, common password patterns, and flexible date handling. Perfect for security researchers, penetration testers, and anyone interested in understanding password creation patterns.

## Features

- **Interactive Mode**: Answer simple questions about the target to create a tailored wordlist.
- **Advanced Leet-Speak**: Automatically generates variations like `4nn4`, `R1c0`, `7e57`.
- **Separators**: Adds `-`, `.`, `_` between words (e.g., `John-Fluffy`, `John.Fluffy`).
- **Common Patterns**: Includes popular suffixes like `1234`, `qwerty`, `!@#`.
- **Date Handling**: Supports `DD/MM/YYYY` input with multiple formats (e.g., `15031995`, `15-03-1995`).
- **Minimum Length Filter**: Customize the minimum password length (default: 6).
- **Output**: Saves the generated passwords to a timestamped file (e.g., `passwords_20250330_123456.txt`).
